## Overview

So, hey there!

This is Challenge 1 (Easy Challenge) of the Topcoder Data Science
Skill Builder Challenge


## Installing Python

Make sure that you have the latest version of Python installed, mine is Python 3.10.4 and my operating system is Windows 10 (Build 21H2) 64-bit

Head over to https://www.python.org/download
After which you will run the following command in your command-line or Terminal

`python --version`

The above command should print out the Python version you have installed on your machine. If it doesn't, you will have to uninstall and reinstall Python. Don't forget to add Python to PATH during the installation process.


## Installing Jupyter Notebooks and Matplotlib

Next, you want to install Jupyter Notebooks on your local machine
Do so by navigating to https://jupyter.org/install

Next, open your command-line (or Terminal) and type the following command

`python -m pip install notebook matplotlib`

The command would install a bunch of Python packages and dependencies, so exercise some patience as this may take a few minutes, depending on the specs of your local machine.


## Running Jupyter Notebooks

There are two ways to run Jupyter Notebooks on your local machine and you can do that by either running in directly in Visual Studio Code or in your favorite browser (I'm using Microsoft Edge). Bear in mind that running Jupyter Notebooks from inside VS Code is very tricky and you can break a lot of things in the process, so I'd advise you to run in your browser using the following command in command-line (or Terminal)

`jupyter notebook`

## Finished

You're done... Now you can take my source code and give Data Science a try using Jupyter Notebook inside your favorite browser
